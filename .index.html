      <h1> Basics of Git and Github </h1>
      <h1> Introductory for Beginners </h1>
        <h2> What is Git? </h2>
          <p> Git is a <u>Version control system</u> or for tracking changes in a file.
          This is usually used for collaboration for its speed and a non linear 
          Workflow.</p>
        <h2> What is Github? </h2>
          <p> Github is an internet hosting site that is used with git. Github provides
            a web <u>GUI</u> (Graphical User Interface) experience for Git and distributing
             source code in public. 
          </p>
        <h2> Difference </h2>
          <p> 3 Main Differences of Git and Github</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Interface</li>
                <p> The interface of Git is <u>CLI</u>(Command Line interface) which means
              it mostly uses text commands for input and the environment you're
              working on is mostly in command line. Eventhough Git have a GUI
              (Graphical User Interface) it's still limited in functionality
              and not featured enough to use professionaly. On the other hand, Github
              have a Web graohical user interface to easily manage large projects.</p>
              <li> Collaboration</li>
                <p> Collaboration is where <b>Github</b> shines brightly because of its 
                interface and convenience. The convenience of github is due to fact 
               that it can be access without the need of downloading an app again.
               </p>
              <li> Storage </li>
                <p> In terms of storage, The main difference is Git is local and
                  Github is cloud based. This means that Git stores data directly 
                  in your computer's hard drive but Github stores it into the cloud 
                  so in case there's a problem in your computer, you can still access
                  it. The downside to this system is if you're in a place
                  without internet then you're stuck with the local copy of 
                  the repository. 
                </p>
