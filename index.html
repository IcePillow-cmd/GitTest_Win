          <h2> What is Git? </h2>
          <p> Git is a <u>Version control system</u> or for tracking changes in a file.
          This is usually used for collaboration for its speed and a non linear 
          Workflow.</p>

        <div id="ghwhat">
          <h2> What is Github? </h2>  
          <p> Github is an internet hosting site that is used with git. Github provides
            a web <u>GUI</u> (Graphical User Interface) experience for Git and distributing
              source code in public. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="difference">
          <h2> Difference </h2>
            <p> 3 Main Differences of Git and Github</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Interface</li>
                  <p> The interface of Git is <u>CLI</u>(Command Line interface) which means
                it mostly uses text commands for input and the environment you're
                working on is mostly in command line. Eventhough Git have a GUI
                (Graphical User Interface) it's still limited in functionality
                and not featured enough to use professionaly. On the other hand, Github
                have a Web graohical user interface to easily manage large projects.</p>
                <li> Collaboration</li>
                  <p> Collaboration is where <b>Github</b> shines brightly because of its 
                  interface and convenience. The convenience of github is due to fact 
                 that it can be access without the need of downloading an app again.
                 </p>
                <li> Storage </li>
                  <p> In terms of storage, The main difference is Git is local and
                    Github is cloud based. This means that Git stores data directly 
                    in your computer's hard drive but Github stores it into the cloud 
                    so in case there's a problem in your computer, you can still access
                    it. The downside to this system is if you're in a place
                    without internet then you're stuck with the local copy of 
                    the repository.

              <p> In some point you'll need to know the basic commands in the command line.
                  Don't be afraid though because it is simple as long you'll get 
                  along with the unfamiliar terms and concept. Commands are just 
                  buttons in text as I like to call it
