          <h2> What is Git? </h2>
          <p> Git is a <u>Version control system</u> or for tracking changes in a file.
          This is usually used for collaboration for its speed and a non linear 
          Workflow.</p>

          <h2> What is Github? </h2>  
          <p> Github is an internet hosting site that is used with git. Github provides
            a web <u>GUI</u> (Graphical User Interface) experience for Git and distributing
              source code in public.

            <h3>Main Differences of Git and Github:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Purpose</li>
                  <p>The purpose of <strong>Git</strong> is to make track of the changes in folder. It is also used to provide non-linear workflows for collaborators to prevent them from stepping on their toes. </p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, the purpose of <strong>Github</strong> is to host the git repository in its website. This is for open-source projects and cloud-based collaboration.</p>
                <li>Availability and storage</li>
                <p>While git repositories can be stored in your local system, github repositories is store on the cloud. The availability of the repository will depend if the repository is cloud-based or not. If the repository is not cloud-based, you can only access it in your local device (desktop).</p>

              <p> In some point you'll need to know the basic commands in the command line.
                  Don't be afraid though because it is simple as long you'll get 
                  along with the unfamiliar terms and concept. Commands are just 
                  buttons in text as I like to call it
